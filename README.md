Remote Desktop Blocker and Port Disabler Tool

The Remote Desktop Blocker and Port Disabler Tool is a security solution designed to enhance network and system protection by preventing unauthorized access. It offers two key features: blocking Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access and disabling specific network ports.

Remote Desktop Blocking: This feature blocks the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), a commonly targeted service used for accessing computers remotely. By disabling RDP, the tool ensures that unauthorized users cannot gain remote access to the system, reducing the risk of brute-force attacks and other remote exploitation attempts.

Port Disabling: The tool allows administrators to selectively block or disable specific network ports that may be vulnerable to exploitation. Whether it's a well-known port like SSH (22) or others that might be at risk, the tool provides a quick way to cut off potential attack vectors.
